{"lyrics":"!V1\n O soul are you weary and troubled?\n No light in the darkness you see?\n There's light for a look at the Savior,\n And life more abundant and free:\n\n!C\n Turn your eyes upon Jesus,\n Look full in His wonderful face;\n And the things of earth will grow strangely dim\n In the light of His glory and grace.\n\n!V2\n Through death into life everlasting\n He passed, and we follow Him there;\n Over us sin no more hath dominion\n For more than conquerors we are!\n\n!V3\n His word shall not fail you He promised;\n Believe Him and all will be well.\n Then go to a world that is dying,\n His perfect salvation to tell!\n","presentation":"V1 C V2 C V3 C","title":"Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus"}

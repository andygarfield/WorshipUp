{"body":"; Key of G\n!V1\n Rock of Ages, cleft for me\n Let me hide myself in thee\n Let the water and the blood\n From thy wounded side which flowed\n Be of sin the double cure\n Save from wrath and make me pure\n!V2\n Not the labors of my hands \n Can fulfill thy law's demands \n Could my zeal no respite know\n Could my tears forever flow\n This for sin could not atone\n Thou must save, and thou alone\n!V3\n Nothing in my hand I bring\n Simply to thy cross I cling\n Naked, come to thee for dress\n Helpless, look to thee for grace\n Foul, I to the fountain fly\n Wash me, Savior, or I die\n Wash me, Savior, or I die\n!V4\n While I draw this fleeting breath\n When I shall close my eyes in death\n When I rise to worlds unknown\n And behold thee on thy throne\n Rock of Ages, cleft for me\n ||\n Let me hide myself\n Let me hide\n Let me hide myself in thee\n Let me hide myself\n Let me hide\n Let me hide myself in thee\n","presentation":"V1 V2 V3 V4","title":"Rock of Ages"}

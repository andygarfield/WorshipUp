  <lyrics>; Key of G
[V1]
 Rock of Ages, cleft for me
 Let me hide myself in thee
 Let the water and the blood
 From thy wounded side which flowed
 Be of sin the double cure
 Save from wrath and make me pure
[V2]
 Not the labors of my hands 
 Can fulfill thy law's demands 
 Could my zeal no respite know
 Could my tears forever flow
 This for sin could not atone
 Thou must save, and thou alone
[V3]
 Nothing in my hand I bring
 Simply to thy cross I cling
 Naked, come to thee for dress
 Helpless, look to thee for grace
 Foul, I to the fountain fly
 Wash me, Savior, or I die
 Wash me, Savior, or I die
[V4]
 While I draw this fleeting breath
 When I shall close my eyes in death
 When I rise to worlds unknown
 And behold thee on thy throne
 Rock of Ages, cleft for me
 ||
 Let me hide myself
 Let me hide
 Let me hide myself in thee
 Let me hide myself
 Let me hide
 Let me hide myself in thee</lyrics>

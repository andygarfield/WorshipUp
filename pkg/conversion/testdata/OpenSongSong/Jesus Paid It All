  <lyrics>; Key of B
[V1]
 I hear the Savior say
 Thy strength indeed is small
 Child of weakness, watch and pray
 Find in Me thine all in all.
 
[C]
 Jesus paid it all
 All to Him I owe
 Sin had left a crimson stain
 He washed it white as snow
 
[V2]
 Lord, now indeed I find
 Thy pow'r and Thine alone
 Can change the leper's spots
 And melt the heart of stone
 
[V3]
 For nothing good have I
 Where-by Thy grace to claim
 I'll wash my garments white
 In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb
 
[V4]
 And when, before the throne
 I stand in Him complete
 Jesus died my soul to save
 My lips shall still repeat
 
[B]
 Oh praise the one who paid my debt
 And raised this life up from the dead

  <lyrics>; Key of D
 
[V1]
 Take my life and let it be
 Consecrated, Lord, to Thee
 Take my moments and my days,
 Let them flow in ceaseless praise
 ||
 Take my hands and let them move
 At the impulse of Thy love
 Take my feet and let them be
 Swift and beautiful for Thee
 
[V2]
 Take my voice and let me sing
 Always, only for my King
 Take my lips and let them be
 Filled with messages from Thee
 ||
 Take my silver and my gold
 Not a mite would I withhold
 Take my intellect and use
 Every power as You choose
 
[C]
 Here am I, all of me
 Take my life, it's all for Thee
 
[V3]
 Take my will and make it Thine
 It shall be no longer mine
 Take my heart it is Thine own
 It shall be Thy royal throne
 ||
 Take my love, my Lord I pour
 At Your feet it's treasure store
 Take myself and I will be
 Ever, only, all for Thee
 
[E]
 Take myself and I will be
 Ever, only, all for Thee</lyrics>
